          Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS)
        </h1>

        <p className="my-8">
          Verus sees a future where anyone can create their own blockchains
          easily. Currently in development, Verus PBaaS chains allow anyone to
          start up a blockchain that has built-in connectivity and liquidity
          with the Verus ecosystem, all without any programming. Every
          blockchain in the ecosystem is independent and customizable.
        </p>
        <p className="my-8">
          To create a chain one needs to have the VerusID that will be used to
          name the chain. Chains can be nested to any level, so that a chain,
          say “MyChain”, that is launched using a VerusID on the main Verus
          blockchain, can be used to spawn an unlimited number of new chains,
          each of these using identities registered on MyChain, which can be
          priced by the creator of MyChain.
        </p>
        <p className="my-8">
          New chains inherit the 50/50% PoW/PoS consensus mechanism (this may be
          customizable in the future) and has all of the advanced capabilities
          of Verus such as fractional currencies and Verus Vault protection for
          IDs.
        </p>
        <p className="my-8">
          A newly created chain can be mined by the miners of Verus. A miner in
          the Verus ecosystem can mine up to 22 different PBaaS-chains without
          losing any of the original hash power. This is called Merge-Mining and
          means that new chains have an easier time attracting miners, and chain
          creators can subsidize the mining of their own chain by merge-mining
          Verus and other PBaaS chains.
        </p>
        <p className="my-8">
          PBaaS chains will form the basis for a practically unlimited
          scalability of the Verus system. Popular currencies and tokens can
          exist and be interchangeable on many Verus blockchains, so that they
          won’t be restricted or limited by the capacities of a single
          blockchain. Cross-chain transactions allow the network as a whole to
          scale, by allowing activity to move between chains seamlessly to avoid
          congestion.
        </p>
        <p className="my-8">
          Chains can have customizable characteristics like crowdfunding
          launches with minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically
          refund. Other options include dynamic coin launch pricing based on
          participation, pre-launch participation price discounts,
          pre-conversion reserve currency carve outs, and price-neutral launch
          pre-allocations. Additionally the creator can specify coin supply,
          coin emission with up to three eras and define the price for
          identities. All specified in easy to understand commands and
          parameters, no programming necessary.
