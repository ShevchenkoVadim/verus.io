          Currencies & DeFi
        </h1>
        <p className="my-8 font-p">
          Verus DeFi is a specific way of using the Verus Currency
          functionalities that provides the ability for users to define and make
          use of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) in the form of Fractional
          Currencies.
        </p>
        <p className="my-8 font-p">
          Users can create Fractional Currencies at will, without programming,
          by defining new Currencies on Verus blockchains that are backed by
          on-chain reserves consisting of other useful Currencies, including,
          for example, tokens that represent assets on other blockchains (such
          as Ethereum) via a bridge. Once created, users can interact with these
          Fractional Currencies by:
        </p>
        <ul className="my-8 ml-6 space-y-4 list-disc list-inside font-p">
          <li>
            Using the Fractional Currency as a conversion mechanism (for example
            from VRSC to ETH), since they can automatically convert from one
            Currency to another as long as both Currencies are used as reserves
            in any already-defined Fractional Currency, and
          </li>
          <li>
            Converting their own holdings into a Fractional Currency and holding
            this Currency, which (a) acts as a constantly rebalancing Constant
            Mix Strategy asset, and (b) benefits from fees paid by other users
            who use the currency as a conversion mechanism as described above.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="my-8 font-p">
          Verus DeFi is characterized by ease of use and low barriers to entry
          as Fractional Currencies can be created by anyone without programming,
          and conversion transactions are done as easily as sending a currency
          to oneself (by point-and-click in the GUI, or a simple command in the
          CLI).
        </p>
        <p className="my-8 font-p">
          The Verus project believes that the Verus DeFi system offers real
          advancements in security and efficiency over existing solutions. The
          system provides an opportunity to leverage community liquidity in the
          most efficient ways, providing for the most secure, lowest cost, most
          stable, and fairest system to convert from one Currency to another in
          a decentralized, permissionless manner. And, because of the
          decentralized bridging technology, Verus offers a simple way for users
          in other systems to experiment with these low-cost, scalable,
          easy-to-use solutions.

        <p className="my-8 font-p">
          As a UTXO-based smart-transaction protocol that implements DeFi at the
          protocol level, Verus DeFi offers:
        </p>
        <ul className="my-8 ml-6 space-y-4 list-disc list-inside font-p">
          <li>
            Increased security at the "app level" - Verus DeFi is not
            implemented by having many smart contract authors creating smart
            contracts on top of the protocol, so there can be no exploits by
            searching for unintended "cracks" in the seams between contracts,
          </li>
          <li>
            Increased security at the protocol level - Verus DeFi is implemented
            in the protocol as part of the consensus, following the fundamental
            systems design principle which says that the most important security
            layers should be located in the system/protocol itself, and
          </li>
          <li>
            the Verus protocol solves all transactions simultaneously within a
            block (as opposed to serially, in order, as is done on Ethereum and
            all other systems which use the virtual machine model). This has
            important implications for security, fairness, and efficiency,
            including
          </li>

            <li>elimination of front-running,</li>
            <li>
              enhancing system-wide liquidity, thus reducing slippage, as
              conversions going to and from any given currency within the same
              block are offset against each other, and
            </li>
            <li>
              providing all users converting to and from a currency within the
              same block the same fair price with no spread.
