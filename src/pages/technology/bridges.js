            Decentralized Bridges to Connect Cryptocurrencies
          </h1>
          <p className="my-8">
            Verus develops bridges to other cryptocurrencies. Bridges connect
            external blockchains and their currencies to the Verus blockchain.
            This means that users can freely transfer coins from another
            blockchain to the Verus blockchain and vice versa. The coins from
            the external blockchain are represented as tokens on the Verus
            blockchain.
          </p>
          <p className="my-8">
            Through bridges, value from other blockchains flow into the Verus
            ecosystem. This value (tokenized ETH and all ERC-20 tokens) can then
            utilize all the features Verus has to offer. For example storing
            your cryptocurrency under the security of a VerusID, buying
            fractional and reserve currencies, converting currencies, financing
            projects and much more.
          </p>
          <p className="my-8">
            ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain donâ€™t have to rely on
            exchange listings anymore. They can find instant liquidity through
            the Verus reserve currency system. They are also freed from the
            exorbitant transaction fees of the Ethereum network. Tokens created
            on Verus also become available on the Ethereum network as ERC-20
            tokens, making a Verus token launch plus the Verus/ETH bridge one of
            the best ways to create new ERC-20 tokens!
          </p>
          <p className="my-8">
            The Ethereum/ERC-20 bridge will be the first bridge enabled, with
            others to follow. Developers who would like to build their own
            bridge to Verus are welcome to reach out for guidance via Discord.
